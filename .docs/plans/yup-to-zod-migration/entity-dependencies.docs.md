## Database Relationship Mapping

### Primary Relationships (Foreign Key Dependencies)

1. **Organizations (Root Entity)**
   - Self-referencing: `parent_organization_id` ‚Üí `organizations.id`
   - Manager references: `primary_manager_id`, `secondary_manager_id` ‚Üí `contacts.id`

2. **Contacts ‚Üí Organizations**
   - **Dependency**: `organization_id` ‚Üí `organizations.id` (NOT NULL)
   - **Risk Level**: Medium (nullable in forms but required in database)

3. **Products ‚Üí Organizations**
   - **Dependency**: `principal_id` ‚Üí `organizations.id` (NOT NULL)
   - **Risk Level**: Low (independent validation)

4. **Opportunities ‚Üí Multiple Entities**
   - **Dependencies**:
     - `organization_id` ‚Üí `organizations.id` (NOT NULL)
     - `contact_id` ‚Üí `contacts.id` (nullable)
     - `principal_organization_id` ‚Üí `organizations.id` (nullable)
     - `distributor_organization_id` ‚Üí `organizations.id` (nullable)
   - **Risk Level**: High (complex cross-entity validation)

5. **Interactions ‚Üí Opportunities**
   - **Dependency**: `opportunity_id` ‚Üí `opportunities.id` (NOT NULL)
   - **Additional**: `contact_id`, `organization_id` (nullable but validated)
   - **Risk Level**: Critical (highest dependency chain)

### Secondary Relationships (Junction Tables)

- **Contact Preferred Principals**: `contact_id` + `principal_organization_id`
- **Opportunity Participants**: `opportunity_id` + `organization_id`
- **Opportunity Products**: `opportunity_id` + `product_id`
- **Principal Distributor Relationships**: `principal_id` + `distributor_id`

## Form Interdependencies & Cross-Entity Validation

### Complex Validation Patterns

1. **Contact Forms with Organization Creation**
   ```typescript
   // Current Yup pattern in contact.types.ts
   organization_mode: 'existing' | 'new'
   organization_name: string (required when mode='new')
   organization_type: required when creating new org
   ```

2. **Opportunity Forms with Multiple Principals**
   ```typescript
   // Multi-principal creation from opportunity.types.ts
   principals: string[] (min 1 required)
   auto_generated_name: boolean
   opportunity_context: required for auto-naming
   ```

3. **Interaction Forms with Opportunity Creation**
   ```typescript
   // Opportunity creation embedded in interaction.types.ts
   create_opportunity: boolean
   opportunity_name: required when create_opportunity=true
   opportunity_stage: required when creating opportunity
   ```

### Form Transform Dependencies

All entities use `FormTransforms` utility functions:
- `nullableString` - Transform empty strings to null
- `nullableEmail` - Email validation with null handling
- `nullablePhone` - Phone number formatting
- `nullableUrl` - URL validation
- `uuidField` - UUID validation with null handling
- `optionalArray` - Array field handling

## Migration Order Recommendations

### Phase 1: Foundation (Low Risk) - Organizations & Products
**Order**: Organizations ‚Üí Products
**Rationale**: Organizations is root entity; Products have simple dependencies
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 weeks

#### Organizations Migration
- **Risk Assessment**: LOW ‚úÖ
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (self-referencing only)
- **Form Complexity**: Moderate (address fields, type validation)
- **Test Strategy**: Unit tests for schema, integration tests for form submission

#### Products Migration
- **Risk Assessment**: LOW ‚úÖ
- **Dependencies**: Only depends on Organizations (via principal_id)
- **Form Complexity**: Low (enum-based category, pricing fields)
- **Test Strategy**: Schema validation, principal relationship validation

### Phase 2: User-Facing Entities (Medium Risk) - Contacts
**Order**: Contacts (after Organizations complete)
**Rationale**: Dependent on Organizations; has cross-entity creation logic
**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 weeks

#### Contacts Migration
- **Risk Assessment**: MEDIUM ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Dependencies**: Organizations (required), cross-entity organization creation
- **Form Complexity**: HIGH (organization_mode logic, preferred principals)
- **Critical Patterns**:
  ```typescript
  // Complex conditional validation
  organization_name.when('organization_mode', {
    is: 'new',
    then: required('Organization name required when creating new org')
  })
  ```
- **Test Strategy**: Complex conditional validation testing, organization creation flows

### Phase 3: Business Logic Entities (High Risk) - Opportunities
**Order**: Opportunities (after Contacts complete)
**Rationale**: Complex multi-entity dependencies, critical business logic
**Estimated Duration**: 4-5 weeks

#### Opportunities Migration
- **Risk Assessment**: HIGH ‚ö°
- **Dependencies**: Organizations, Contacts, multi-principal logic
- **Form Complexity**: CRITICAL (auto-naming, stage progression, multiple principals)
- **Critical Patterns**:
  ```typescript
  // Multi-principal opportunity creation
  multiPrincipalOpportunitySchema with auto-naming logic
  generateOpportunityName() utility integration
  Stage progression validation with OPPORTUNITY_STAGE_ORDER
  ```
- **Test Strategy**: Complex business logic validation, multi-entity relationship testing, stage progression validation

### Phase 4: Integration Layer (Critical Risk) - Interactions
**Order**: Interactions (final phase)
**Rationale**: Highest dependency chain, can create Opportunities dynamically
**Estimated Duration**: 5-6 weeks

#### Interactions Migration
- **Risk Assessment**: CRITICAL üî•
- **Dependencies**: All other entities, embedded opportunity creation
- **Form Complexity**: MAXIMUM (opportunity creation, priority mapping, principal tracking)
- **Critical Patterns**:
  ```typescript
  // Dynamic opportunity creation within interaction
  interactionWithOpportunitySchema
  Mobile templates with MOBILE_INTERACTION_TEMPLATES
  Priority color mapping integration
  Account manager validation
  ```
- **Test Strategy**: End-to-end validation, embedded opportunity creation, mobile template validation

## Testing Strategy for Each Entity

   - Feature flag new validations for gradual rollout
   - Extensive A/B testing between validation systems

2. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - 100% test coverage for all schema migrations
   - Integration tests for cross-entity validation
   - End-to-end testing for complex workflows

3. **Rollback Strategy**
   - Maintain backward compatibility during transition
   - Database constraints as safety net for validation
   - Monitoring and alerting for validation failures

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Equivalence**: All existing form validations work identically with Zod
2. **Performance Maintenance**: No degradation in form validation performance
3. **Type Safety Enhancement**: Improved TypeScript inference with Zod schemas
4. **Developer Experience**: Simpler schema definitions and better error messages
5. **Test Coverage**: 100% test coverage maintained throughout migration
6. **Zero Regressions**: No functional regressions in form behavior or validation

## Monitoring & Validation

- **Schema Validation Metrics**: Track validation success/failure rates
- **Form Submission Analytics**: Monitor form completion rates during transition
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: Alert on increased validation errors
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track form validation timing
- **User Experience Metrics**: Monitor support tickets related to form issues

## Conclusion

The migration from Yup to Zod should follow the dependency order: Organizations ‚Üí Products ‚Üí Contacts ‚Üí Opportunities ‚Üí Interactions. This approach minimizes risk by migrating foundation entities first and building up through the dependency chain. The most critical phase will be Interactions due to its complex cross-entity validation and embedded opportunity creation logic.

Key success factors:
- Maintain comprehensive testing throughout migration
- Implement gradual rollout with feature flags
- Preserve all existing validation logic and business rules
- Monitor closely for regressions during transition
- Maintain backward compatibility until migration is complete

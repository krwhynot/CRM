# Active Context

## Current Work

Initializing the Memory Bank by creating core documentation files. This includes defining the project brief, product context, system patterns, technical context, and tracking progress.

## Recent Changes

- Created `.clinerules` directory and populated it with five markdown files.
- Added `06-memory-bank.md` to document Cline's memory bank structure and workflows.
- Created the `memory-bank` directory.
- Created `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`.
- Created `memory-bank/productContext.md`.
- Created `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
- Created `memory-bank/techContext.md`.

## Next Steps

- Create `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file).
- Create `memory-bank/progress.md`.
- Review and potentially update all memory bank files based on current understanding.
- Confirm with the user that the memory bank initialization is complete.

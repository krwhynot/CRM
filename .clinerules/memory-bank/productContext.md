# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

This project was initiated to solve the problem of decentralized and inefficient customer relationship management. The sales team currently relies on spreadsheets and manual tracking, leading to lost opportunities and inconsistent communication.

## How It Should Work

The CRM should provide a central dashboard to view and manage contacts, organizations, and sales opportunities. Users should be able to log interactions, set reminders, and track the progress of deals through a sales pipeline.

## User Experience Goals

- **Intuitive:** The interface should be easy to learn and use, requiring minimal training.
- **Efficient:** Common tasks should be quick to perform, with streamlined workflows.
- **Responsive:** The application should be fast and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

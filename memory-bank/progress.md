# Progress

## What Works

- The `.clinerules` directory and its contents are established.
- The `memory-bank` directory has been created.
- Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been created with initial content.

## What's Left to Build

- Create `memory-bank/progress.md` (this file).
- Review and potentially update all memory bank files to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- Confirm with the user that the memory bank initialization is complete.

## Current Status

Memory bank initialization is in progress. All core files except `progress.md` are created.

## Known Issues

None at this time.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

The decision to create a structured memory bank was driven by the need for persistent context across sessions, as per Cline's operational model. The chosen file structure and content are based on the provided guidelines.

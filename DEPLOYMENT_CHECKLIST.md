# KitchenPantry CRM - Deployment Checklist

## 🎯 Current Status: Ready for Database Deployment

All foundation components are complete and ready for deployment:
- ✅ Project structure initialized
- ✅ Authentication system working  
- ✅ Database schema designed
- ✅ TypeScript types generated
- ✅ RLS security policies created
- ✅ API service layer implemented

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### **Step 1: Apply Database Schema**
1. Open [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) → Your Project
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of:
   ```
   database/migrations/001_initial_crm_schema.sql
   ```
4. Click **Run** to execute
5. Verify success - should create 7 tables and 6 ENUM types

### **Step 2: Deploy RLS Security Policies**
1. In the same SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of:
   ```
   database/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql
   ```
3. Click **Run** to execute
4. Verify success - should enable RLS on all tables

### **Step 3: Verification Queries**
Run these queries to confirm successful deployment:

```sql
-- Check tables were created
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check ENUM types
SELECT enumname, enumlabel 
FROM pg_enum e 
JOIN pg_type t ON e.enumtypid = t.oid 
ORDER BY enumname, enumlabel;

-- Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND rowsecurity = true;

-- Check policies exist
SELECT COUNT(*) as policy_count 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

### **Expected Results:**
- **Tables**: 7 tables (organizations, contacts, products, opportunities, interactions, opportunity_products, principal_distributor_relationships)
- **ENUMs**: 6 enum types with all valid values
- **RLS Enabled**: All 7 tables should have `rowsecurity = true`
- **Policies**: Should have 20+ RLS policies

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **Before Deployment:**
- ⚠️ **Backup existing data** if you have any test data
- ⚠️ **Run in development first** to test the migration
- ⚠️ **Have rollback scripts ready** in case of issues

### **Environment Variables:**
Make sure your `.env.local` has correct Supabase credentials:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### **Authentication Testing:**
After schema deployment, test the authentication flow:
1. Visit `http://localhost:3002`
2. Try sign-up with a new email
3. Confirm email and sign in
4. Verify dashboard loads without errors

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

1. **Migration Fails:**
   - Check for syntax errors in SQL
   - Verify you have proper permissions
   - Run queries one section at a time

2. **RLS Policies Block Access:**
   - Verify user is authenticated: `SELECT auth.uid()`
   - Check policy conditions match your user context
   - Use debug queries in `RLS_TEST_QUERIES.sql`

3. **Type Errors in Frontend:**
   - Regenerate types if schema changed
   - Check import paths in service files
   - Verify Supabase client configuration

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Supabase logs in dashboard
2. Review error messages in browser console
3. Run the test queries to isolate problems
4. Check the `database/RLS_SECURITY_MODEL.md` for detailed security documentation

## Next Phase: UI Development

Once database deployment is complete, we'll proceed with:
1. 🔄 **Pinia stores** for state management
2. 🏢 **Organizations interface** for company management  
3. 👥 **Contacts interface** for people management
4. 📦 **Products catalog** for inventory
5. 💰 **Opportunities pipeline** for sales tracking

Ready to build the CRM interface! 🚀

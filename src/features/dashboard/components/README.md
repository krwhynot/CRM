# Dashboard Components

This directory contains the minimal dashboard implementation for the KitchenPantry CRM system.

## Current Implementation

### Main Component
- **CRMDashboard.tsx** - Minimal dashboard component that provides a clean welcome screen

The dashboard currently displays a simple welcome message and serves as a starting point for future dashboard features. This clean, minimal approach allows for easy customization and expansion as needed.

## Future Development

The dashboard is designed to be easily extensible for future enhancements such as:
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Summary statistics  
- Activity feeds
- Charts and visualizations
- Quick action shortcuts

## Technical Notes

- Built with React + TypeScript
- Uses shadcn/ui for consistent styling
- Follows mobile-first responsive design
- Ready for integration with TanStack Query for data fetching
- Prepared for Zustand integration for UI state management

## Usage

```typescript
import { CRMDashboard } from '@/features/dashboard'

export function DashboardPage() {
  return <CRMDashboard />
}
```

The component is exported from the feature index and can be easily integrated into any routing system.

# KitchenPantry CRM - Page Overview (MVP COMPLETE)

**Tech Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Supabase + shadcn/ui  
**Status**: ✅ Production-ready MVP deployed and validated  
**Authentication**: Supabase Auth with protected routes

## Overall Purpose

The KitchenPantry CRM is designed specifically for Sales Managers who work with food industry principals (manufacturers like cheese makers, specialty food producers, etc.) to build and maintain strong business relationships. Unlike traditional CRMs that focus on closing deals and tracking revenue, this system prioritizes relationship quality and engagement over financial metrics. Sales Managers use this tool to track how well they're connecting with each principal, when they last spoke, what products the principal offers, and which customers might be interested in those products.

The core philosophy is that strong relationships lead to better business outcomes. By tracking engagement levels, interaction history, and relationship health, Sales Managers can identify which principals need more attention, which relationships are thriving, and where opportunities exist to connect principals with the right customers. This approach helps build a sustainable network of partnerships rather than just focusing on immediate sales.

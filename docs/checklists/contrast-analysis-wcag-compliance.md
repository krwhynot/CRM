## üéØ **PHASE 1: ENVIRONMENT SETUP & BASELINE TESTING**

### ‚òê 1.1 Development Server Verification
**What**: Confirm the CRM application is running locally  
**Why**: Live testing provides accurate contrast measurements vs. theoretical calculations  
**How**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5174` and verify application loads properly  
**Success Criteria**: Homepage displays with navigation, can switch between light/dark themes

### ‚òê 1.2 Theme Switching Validation  
**What**: Test light/dark mode toggle functionality  
**Why**: Both themes must maintain WCAG compliance independently  
**How**: Locate theme toggle (usually in header/settings) and switch between modes  
**Success Criteria**: All content remains visible and readable in both themes

### ‚òê 1.3 Browser Tools Setup
**What**: Configure browser developer tools for contrast analysis  
**Why**: Accurate contrast measurement requires proper tooling  
**How**: Enable accessibility auditing in Chrome/Firefox dev tools, install contrast checker extensions  
**Success Criteria**: Can measure contrast ratios for any text/background combination

---

## üîç **PHASE 2: TEXT CONTRAST ANALYSIS**

### ‚òê 2.1 Primary Text Validation
**What**: Measure contrast of main body text against backgrounds  
**Why**: Most critical for overall readability  
**Expected Values**:
- Light mode: `#171717` on `#FAFAFA` (should be ~16:1 - AAA)
- Dark mode: `#FAFAFA` on `#0A0A0B` (should be ~16:1 - AAA)  
**Test Locations**: Any paragraph text, table content, form labels  
**Pass/Fail**: Must achieve 4.5:1 minimum (7:1 for AAA)

### ‚òê 2.2 Muted Text Assessment  
**What**: Check secondary/muted text contrast  
**Why**: These often fail contrast requirements but are used for less critical information  
**Expected Values**:
- Light mode: `#666666` on `#FAFAFA` (~4.5:1 - borderline)
- Dark mode: `#A6A6A6` on `#0A0A0B` (~4.2:1 - potential failure)  
**Test Locations**: Captions, helper text, timestamps, secondary information  
**Action Required**: If below 4.5:1, recommend darker colors

### ‚òê 2.3 Brand Color Validation
**What**: Verify MFB Green accessibility across contexts  
**Why**: Brand color must work while maintaining visual identity  
**Expected Values**: MFB Green `#8DC63F` should achieve ~4.9:1 on white backgrounds  
**Test Locations**: Primary buttons, links, accent elements  
**Brand Constraint**: Cannot significantly alter brand color - adjust backgrounds instead

## üé® **PHASE 3: COMPONENT CONTRAST AUDIT**

### ‚òê 3.1 Button Variants Testing
**What**: Test all button states and variants  
**Components to Test**:
- Default (MFB Green background)
- Secondary (gray background)  
- Outline (border only)
- Ghost (transparent background)
- Destructive (red/error)
- Success (green)
- Warning (yellow/amber)

**States to Test**: Default, hover, focus, active, disabled  
**Why**: Buttons are primary interaction elements - must be clearly distinguishable  
**Focus Areas**: Text on button backgrounds, focus ring visibility, hover state contrast

### ‚òê 3.2 Form Component Analysis
**What**: Validate form inputs, labels, and validation messages  
**Components to Test**:
- Input fields (text, select, textarea)
- Form labels
- Placeholder text
- Validation error messages
- Focus states and rings

**Why**: Forms are critical for data entry - poor contrast causes errors  
**Special Attention**: Error messages must be highly visible, focus rings must meet 3:1 contrast

### ‚òê 3.3 Status Indicator Evaluation
**What**: Check semantic color indicators  
**Critical Issue**: Status indicators currently use hardcoded Tailwind colors instead of CSS variables  
**Components to Test**:
- Success indicators (green variants)
- Warning indicators (yellow/amber variants)
- Error/destructive indicators (red variants)
- Info indicators (blue variants)

**Architecture Problem**: These don't respect theme switching properly  
**Required Action**: Must be migrated to use CSS custom properties

## 🏗️ **PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZED DATABASE ARCHITECTURE**

### Emergency Response Indexes (CREATE BEFORE INCIDENTS)
```sql
-- Priority 1: Emergency diagnostic indexes for sub-second response
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_emergency_orgs_type_active 
ON organizations (type, deleted_at) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_emergency_orgs_principal 
ON organizations (is_principal, deleted_at, type) 
WHERE is_principal = true AND deleted_at IS NULL;

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_emergency_orgs_distributor 
ON organizations (is_distributor, deleted_at, type) 
WHERE is_distributor = true AND deleted_at IS NULL;

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_emergency_contacts_primary 
ON contacts (is_primary, deleted_at, organization_id) 
WHERE is_primary = true AND deleted_at IS NULL;

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_emergency_priority_validation 
ON organizations (priority, deleted_at) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_emergency_principal_distributor_rel 
ON principal_distributor_relationships (principal_id, distributor_id, relationship_status, deleted_at);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_emergency_opportunities_active 
ON opportunities (stage, deleted_at, close_date, created_at) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

### Connection Pool Configuration
```sql
-- Reserve emergency connections (add to connection pool config)
-- Total connections: 15 (3 reserved for emergency diagnostics)
-- Emergency connection timeout: 1 second (vs normal 30 seconds)
-- Query timeout during emergencies: 5 seconds max
```

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION emergency_org_health_check(limit_count INT DEFAULT 100)
RETURNS TABLE(
  validation_type TEXT,
  violation_count BIGINT,
  execution_time_ms NUMERIC
) AS $$
DECLARE
  start_time TIMESTAMP;
  end_time TIMESTAMP;
BEGIN
  -- Principal-Distributor relationship check
  start_time := clock_timestamp();
  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO violation_count
  FROM organizations p
  JOIN principal_distributor_relationships pr ON p.id = pr.principal_id  
  JOIN organizations d ON pr.distributor_id = d.id
  WHERE p.is_principal = true AND d.is_distributor = true
    AND (pr.relationship_status != 'active' OR pr.deleted_at IS NOT NULL)
    AND p.deleted_at IS NULL AND d.deleted_at IS NULL
  LIMIT limit_count;
  
  end_time := clock_timestamp();
  validation_type := 'Principal-Distributor Relationships';
  execution_time_ms := EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (end_time - start_time)) * 1000;
  RETURN NEXT;

  -- Additional validations with timing...
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

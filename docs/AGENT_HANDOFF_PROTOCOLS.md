# Agent Handoff Protocols
## Standardized Procedures for Inter-Agent Work Transfer

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** Define standardized protocols for transferring work between specialized agents during phase transitions  
**Scope:** 14 specialized agents across 4 development phases with critical dependency management

---

## 1. Protocol Overview

### 1.1 Handoff Philosophy
Agent handoffs represent critical transition points where work products, context, and responsibility transfer from one specialized agent to another. Successful handoffs ensure:
- **Continuity** - No loss of progress or context
- **Quality** - Work products meet receiving agent requirements
- **Efficiency** - Minimal ramp-up time for receiving agent
- **Accountability** - Clear ownership transfer with documentation

### 1.2 Handoff Categories
- **Sequential Handoff** - Direct work product transfer (A → B)
- **Parallel Coordination** - Concurrent work with shared deliverables (A ↔ B)
- **Support Handoff** - Supporting agent provides expertise (A supports B)
- **Phase Transition** - Multiple agents transitioning between phases

### 1.3 Critical Success Factors
- **Complete Documentation** - All work products documented
- **Quality Validation** - Receiving agent validates work quality
- **Context Transfer** - Background knowledge and decisions documented
- **Resource Availability** - Required tools and access transferred
- **Stakeholder Communication** - All stakeholders informed of transition

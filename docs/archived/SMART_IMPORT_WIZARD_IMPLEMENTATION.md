# Smart Import Wizard Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Smart Import Wizard is an AI-enhanced CSV import system that replaces the existing static import functionality with intelligent field mapping, data validation, and duplicate detection capabilities. Built with iPad-first design principles for optimal field sales team usage.

## Architecture

### Phase 1: Smart Wizard Foundation (✅ COMPLETED)

The implementation follows the research-validated 3-phase plan with comprehensive component architecture:

#### Core Components

1. **SmartImportOrchestrator** (`/wizard/components/SmartImportOrchestrator.tsx`)
   - Main orchestrator component that manages the entire wizard flow
   - Handles navigation, state transitions, and step validation
   - Integrates all wizard steps and provides consistent navigation

2. **SmartImportWizard** (`/wizard/components/SmartImportWizard.tsx`)  
   - 5-step wizard container with iPad-optimized UI
   - Visual progress tracking and step indicators
   - Touch-friendly navigation with 48px minimum touch targets
   - Steps: Upload → Map Fields → Preview → Import → Complete

3. **SmartUploadStep** (`/wizard/components/SmartUploadStep.tsx`)
   - Drag-and-drop file upload with progress tracking
   - Entity type selection (Organizations vs Contacts)  
   - Template download functionality
   - File validation and error handling

4. **SmartFieldMapping** (`/wizard/components/SmartFieldMapping.tsx`)
   - AI-powered field mapping with confidence scoring
   - Interactive mapping table with alternatives
   - Confidence badges: Green (≥85%), Yellow (70-84%), Red (<70%)
   - Manual override capabilities

5. **SmartPreviewStep** (`/wizard/components/SmartPreviewStep.tsx`)
   - Data preview with validation results
   - Tabbed interface: Preview, Validation, Duplicates, Mapping
   - Quality score dashboard
   - Error/warning management

#### State Management

**useSmartImport Hook** (`/wizard/hooks/useSmartImport.ts`)
- Centralized state management for wizard flow
- Integrated AI service calls with fallback handling
- Progress tracking and error management
- Configuration management (entity type, validation settings)

#### AI Integration Layer

**OpenAI Service** (`/lib/openai.ts`)
- GPT-3.5-turbo integration with structured outputs
- Cost-optimized API calls (sampling, batching, caching)
- Three main functions:
  - `suggestFieldMappings()` - Smart field mapping with confidence
  - `validateRowsWithAI()` - Data quality validation
  - `detectDuplicatesWithAI()` - Duplicate detection

**Zod Schemas** (`/lib/aiSchemas.ts`)
- Structured API responses using zodResponseFormat
- Type-safe AI integration with deterministic outputs
- Comprehensive validation types and confidence scoring

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ iPad-First Design
- **48px minimum touch targets** for all interactive elements
- **Responsive grid layouts** adapting from mobile to desktop
- **Touch-optimized interactions** with active states and haptic feedback
- **Swipe-friendly navigation** with large, clear buttons
- **Card-based layout** reducing cognitive load

### ✅ AI-Powered Smart Mapping  
- **Semantic field detection** - recognizes "Company" as "Organization Name"
- **Confidence scoring** with automatic thresholds (85% auto-apply, 70-84% confirm, <70% manual)
- **Alternative suggestions** with reasoning explanations
- **Graceful fallback** to manual mapping when AI unavailable
- **Field validation** against allow-list to prevent hallucinations

### ✅ Advanced Data Validation
- **Context-aware validation** detecting city/state/ZIP mismatches
- **Quality scoring** with overall data quality percentage
- **Issue categorization** (Error/Warning/Info) with specific suggestions
- **Sampling strategy** (50 rows max) for cost control
- **Real-time feedback** during validation process

### ✅ Duplicate Detection
- **Semantic similarity** detection beyond exact string matching
- **Confidence-based grouping** of potential duplicates
- **Action suggestions** (merge, keep first, keep last, manual review)
- **Batch processing** optimized for performance

### ✅ Enhanced UX Features
- **Real-time progress tracking** with batch processing visualization  
- **Error recovery** with detailed error messages and suggestions
- **Template system** with downloadable CSV templates
- **Preview functionality** showing first 10 rows with mapped fields
- **Step validation** preventing progression until requirements met

## Integration Requirements

### Dependencies

```

## Cost Optimization Strategy

Based on research validation, the implementation includes several cost controls:

1. **API Sampling**: Maximum 3-5 rows for field mapping, 50 rows for validation
2. **Model Selection**: GPT-3.5-turbo for cost efficiency vs. GPT-4
3. **Caching Strategy**: Reuse mapping results for similar file structures  
4. **Batching**: Process multiple operations in single API calls
5. **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to manual mapping when AI unavailable

**Estimated Costs**: <$20/month for typical usage (500 imports/month, 100 rows average)

## Security Considerations

1. **Server-side API calls** - OpenAI key never exposed to client
2. **Data sampling** - Only headers + sample rows sent to AI
3. **Allow-list validation** - Prevent AI from suggesting invalid fields
4. **Input sanitization** - All user data validated before AI processing
5. **Privacy compliance** - Option to disable AI features for sensitive data

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Progressive loading** - Components load as needed per step
2. **Batch processing** - 50 records per batch for import operations  
3. **Virtual scrolling** - Large data previews efficiently rendered
4. **Debounced validation** - Prevent excessive API calls during user input
5. **Lazy loading** - AI services only loaded when needed

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Gradual Integration (Recommended)
1. Deploy alongside existing import system
2. Add feature flag for Smart Import vs. Legacy Import
3. Collect user feedback and AI accuracy metrics
4. Gradually increase adoption based on performance

### Phase 2: Full Replacement
1. Update main import route to use SmartImportOrchestrator
2. Migrate existing templates to new system
3. Add analytics dashboard for AI performance monitoring
4. Implement user training materials

### Example Integration
```tsx
// In App.tsx or routing configuration
import SmartImportOrchestrator from '@/features/import-export/wizard'

function ImportPage() {
  return (
    <SmartImportOrchestrator
      onImportComplete={(result) => {
        // Handle successful import
        if (result.success) {
          toast.success(`Imported ${result.imported} records`)
          navigate('/organizations')
        }
      }}
      onCancel={() => navigate('/organizations')}
    />
  )
}
```

## Testing Strategy

The implementation includes comprehensive validation points:

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component and hook testing
2. **Integration Tests**: Full wizard flow testing
3. **AI Response Tests**: Mocked OpenAI responses for reliability
4. **Error Handling Tests**: Network failures and API errors
5. **Performance Tests**: Large file handling and memory usage
6. **Accessibility Tests**: iPad and screen reader compatibility

## Success Metrics

Based on research validation, track these metrics:

1. **AI Accuracy**: % of field mappings accepted without user modification
2. **Time Savings**: Import setup time vs. legacy system
3. **Data Quality**: % reduction in import errors after AI validation
4. **User Adoption**: Usage rates and satisfaction scores
5. **Cost Efficiency**: API usage vs. manual cleanup costs

# Or browse the project and find something to improve
```

#### Claim the Issue
Comment on the issue:
```markdown

My approach will be:
1. [Describe your planned approach]
2. [Mention any questions you have]

ETA: [Your estimated timeline]
```

### 2. Set Up Your Development Branch

#### Create Feature Branch
```bash

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b fix/improve-contact-form-validation
# or feature/add-loading-states
# or docs/update-setup-guide
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

#### Small Changes (Documentation, Bug Fixes)
For simple changes, work directly in your branch:

```bash
# Make your changes
# Test them locally
# Commit with clear message

git add .
git commit -m "fix: improve contact form email validation

- Add proper email format validation
- Show clear error message for invalid emails
- Update unit tests for new validation

Closes #123"
```

#### Larger Changes (Features, Complex Bugs)
Break your work into smaller commits:

```bash
# Commit 1: Set up the foundation
git add src/components/NewComponent.tsx
git commit -m "feat: add NewComponent foundation"

# Commit 2: Add functionality
git add src/components/NewComponent.tsx src/hooks/useNewFeature.ts
git commit -m "feat: implement core functionality for NewComponent"

# Commit 3: Add tests and polish
git add src/components/NewComponent.test.tsx
git commit -m "test: add comprehensive tests for NewComponent"
```

### 4. Test Your Changes

#### Run Quality Checks
```bash
# TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit

# Linting
npm run lint

### 6. Respond to Code Review

#### Common Review Feedback

**Code Style Issues**
```typescript
// Reviewer might suggest:
// "Use const instead of let for variables that don't change"

// Before
let userName = user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName

// After  
const userName = `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
```

**TypeScript Improvements**
```typescript
// Reviewer might suggest:
// "Define proper interface instead of using any"

// Before
function handleSubmit(data: any) { ... }

// After
interface FormData {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  email: string
}

function handleSubmit(data: FormData) { ... }
```

**React Best Practices**
```typescript
// Reviewer might suggest:
// "Use useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders"

// Before
const handleClick = () => { 
  onSubmit(formData) 
}

// After
const handleClick = useCallback(() => { 
  onSubmit(formData) 
}, [formData, onSubmit])
```

#### Responding to Feedback
1. **Be Responsive**: Reply within 24-48 hours
2. **Ask Questions**: If feedback is unclear, ask for clarification
3. **Make Changes**: Address each comment thoroughly
4. **Test Again**: Re-test after making changes
5. **Say Thank You**: Appreciate the reviewer's time

```bash
# Make requested changes
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: address code review feedback

- Use const instead of let for immutable variables
- Add proper TypeScript interfaces
- Implement useCallback for event handlers

Thanks @reviewer for the feedback!"

# Push updated changes
git push origin fix/improve-contact-form-validation
```

### 7. Merge and Cleanup

#### After Merge
```bash
# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Pull the latest changes (including your merged PR)
git pull origin main

# Delete your feature branch (optional)
git branch -d fix/improve-contact-form-validation

# Delete remote branch (optional)
git push origin --delete fix/improve-contact-form-validation
```

## Tips for Success

## Getting Help

### Where to Ask Questions
1. **GitHub Issues**: Comment on the issue you're working on
2. **Pull Request**: Ask questions in PR comments
3. **GitHub Discussions**: For broader questions about the project

### What to Include When Asking for Help
- **Clear description** of what you're trying to achieve
- **What you've tried** so far
- **Error messages** (full stack traces)
- **Code snippets** showing your current approach
- **Environment details** (OS, Node version, browser)

### Example Help Request
```markdown
I'm working on issue #123 and trying to add email validation to the contact form.

I've implemented the validation using Yup:
```typescript
email: yup
  .string()
  .email('Invalid email format')
  .required('Email is required')
```

But I'm getting a TypeScript error: "Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'never'".

I've looked at other form components but can't figure out what's different. Could someone point me in the right direction?

Environment:
- Node.js: 18.17.0
- TypeScript: 5.0.2
- Browser: Chrome 115
```

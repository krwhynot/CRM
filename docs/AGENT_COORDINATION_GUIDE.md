---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This guide provides the operational framework for implementing the Sub-Agent Coordination Matrix across the 4-phase, 16-week KitchenPantry CRM development timeline. It ensures specialized agents are properly selected, coordinated, and managed for optimal delivery.

### 1.2 Scope
- **Phases:** 4 development phases (Weeks 1-16)
- **Team Size:** 1-2 developers maximum
- **Agent Types:** 14 specialized sub-agents
- **Delivery Model:** Vertical Scaling Workflow implementation

---

## 2. Agent Selection Framework

### 2.1 Priority Classification

**High Priority (Must Have) - Deploy Immediately:**
- Database Schema Architect
- Supabase Integration Specialist  
- Vue Component Architect
- TypeScript API Service Developer

**Medium Priority (Should Have) - Deploy for Complex Features:**
- Pinia Store Manager
- Multi-Step Form Specialist
- Dashboard Component Developer
- TypeScript Error Detective

**Low Priority (Nice to Have) - Deploy as Resources Allow:**
- Performance Optimization Specialist
- Testing Implementation Specialist
- Security Implementation Specialist
- ESLint Compliance Specialist
- Build & Deployment Specialist

### 2.2 Agent Selection Decision Tree

```
Current Phase & Task Assessment
├── Phase 1 (Foundation) → Database Schema Architect (Lead)
├── Phase 2 (Core Features) → Vue Component Architect (Lead)
├── Phase 3 (Dashboard) → Dashboard Component Developer (Lead)
└── Phase 4 (Quality) → Testing Implementation Specialist (Lead)

Task Complexity Assessment
├── Simple (1-3 days) → Use primary agent only
├── Medium (4-7 days) → Primary + 1 supporting agent
└── Complex (1-2 weeks) → Primary + 2-3 supporting agents

Team Size Consideration
├── 1 Developer → Focus on High Priority agents
└── 2 Developers → Split High Priority + share Medium Priority
```

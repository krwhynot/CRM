- **Business Logic Validation:** Validates dropdown options, toggles, and special features
- **Form Submission Validation:** Tests complete form validation workflow

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness Testing

## Testing Architecture

### ComplianceValidator Class
```typescript
class FieldComplianceValidator {
  async validateFormCompliance(formSelector, fieldSpecs, formName, formPath)
  async checkFieldAccessibility(fieldName): FieldValidationResult
  async validateFormValidation(fieldSpecs): ValidationTestResults
  async validateMobileCompliance(formSelector): MobileComplianceResult
  generateComplianceReport(): ComprehensiveReport
}
```

### Field Detection Strategies
1. Direct name/id selectors (`input[name="field_name"]`)
2. React Hook Form selectors (`[data-field="field_name"]`)
3. Test ID selectors (`[data-testid="field_name"]`)
4. Label-based detection (`label:has-text("Field Name") + input`)
5. Accessibility selectors (`[aria-label*="Field Name"]`)

## Validation Results

### Static Code Analysis Results
```
Forms Analyzed: 4
Compliant Forms: 4
Average Score: 100%
Overall Compliance: ✅ PASS

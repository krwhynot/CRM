1. Organization Name
2. Priority (A/B/C/D with color coding)
3. Type (Customer/Distributor/Principal)
4. Segment
5. Phone
6. LinkedIn (clickable external links)
7. Complete Address (street, city, state, zip)
8. Primary Account Manager
9. Secondary Account Manager
10. Notes (truncated with tooltips)

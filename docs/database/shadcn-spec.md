## Design Philosophy & Core Principles

*"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."* - Applied to food service CRM workflows

### Our Design Philosophy

We design for the unique demands of the food service industry, where relationships drive revenue, decisions happen under pressure, and mobile-first thinking isn't optional—it's survival. Our design system embodies the trust, efficiency, and authenticity that Master Food Brokers need to succeed.

### Core Design Principles

**1. Efficiency Under Pressure**  
Sales teams work in noisy restaurants, busy kitchens, and time-sensitive negotiations. Every interaction must be purposeful, every tap intentional, every screen optimized for speed and clarity.

*Application: Large touch targets (48px minimum), high contrast ratios, progressive disclosure of complex information, one-tap access to critical actions.*

**2. Trust Through Consistency**  
Food service relationships involve significant financial commitments and long-term partnerships. Consistent, predictable interface patterns build user confidence and reduce cognitive load during high-stakes interactions.

*Application: Standardized component behaviors, consistent visual hierarchy, reliable feedback patterns, familiar navigation structures.*

**3. Mobile-First Reality**  
Field sales teams live on iPads, accessing the CRM from restaurant floors, distributor warehouses, and client meetings. Desktop optimization follows mobile excellence, never the reverse.

*Application: Touch-first interactions, readable typography in varied lighting, offline-capable core features, thumb-friendly navigation zones.*

**4. Industry Authenticity**  
We speak the language of food service professionals. Our interface reflects deep understanding of distributor relationships, principal partnerships, and operational workflows unique to this industry.

*Application: Industry-specific terminology, workflow patterns that match real-world processes, visual metaphors that resonate with food service professionals.*

**5. Relationship-Centric Design**  
Technology serves human connections. Every feature supports relationship building, every data point tells a story about business partnerships, every interaction strengthens professional bonds.

*Application: People-first information architecture, relationship history prominence, communication flow optimization, trust-building visual cues.*

### Design Decision Framework

When making design decisions, we ask:

1. **Does this reduce cognitive load under pressure?** (Efficiency)
2. **Is this behavior predictable and learnable?** (Trust)  
3. **Will this work on an iPad in a restaurant kitchen?** (Mobile-First)
4. **Does this reflect how food service really works?** (Authenticity)
5. **Does this strengthen business relationships?** (Relationship-Centric)

These principles guide every color choice, every interaction pattern, every content decision in our design system.

## 1) Users & Context: The Food Service Reality

**Product goal:** A comprehensive CRM system built specifically for Master Food Brokers in the food service industry, enabling efficient management of organizations, contacts, products, opportunities, and interactions while strengthening the human relationships that drive business success.

### User Personas & Deep Context

**Sales Managers** — *"I need to track 200+ client relationships while coaching my team and hitting quarterly targets"*
- **Environment:** Office-based but frequently traveling to client sites
- **Technology comfort:** Moderate; values efficiency over features
- **Pain points:** Juggling multiple priorities, need quick access to relationship history, pressure to perform
- **Goals:** Build stronger client relationships, identify growth opportunities, coach field teams effectively
- **Design implications:** Dashboard-first design, quick access patterns, relationship-centric information architecture

**Field Sales Teams** — *"I'm in a noisy restaurant kitchen with 5 minutes to update this opportunity"*
- **Environment:** Restaurant kitchens, distributor warehouses, client meeting rooms
- **Technology comfort:** Varies; primarily iPad users with limited patience for complex interfaces
- **Pain points:** Time pressure, poor network conditions, need hands-free operation capability
- **Goals:** Quick data entry, access to client preferences, capture interaction details efficiently
- **Design implications:** Large touch targets, voice-to-text optimization, offline capability, thumb-friendly navigation

**Operations Teams** — *"I process hundreds of data imports while monitoring system health and generating reports"*
- **Environment:** Office setting with multiple monitors and complex data workflows
- **Technology comfort:** High; power users who value advanced features and shortcuts
- **Pain points:** Data quality issues, time-consuming manual processes, need for bulk operations
- **Goals:** Streamline data processes, ensure system reliability, provide actionable business intelligence
- **Design implications:** Bulk operation patterns, advanced filtering, keyboard shortcuts, error prevention

**System Administrators** — *"I maintain data integrity while ensuring 50+ users have appropriate access"*
- **Environment:** IT-focused office environment with security and compliance requirements
- **Technology comfort:** Expert level; familiar with database concepts and security patterns
- **Pain points:** User permission complexity, data governance, audit trail requirements
- **Goals:** Maintain security, ensure compliance, provide user support, manage system evolution
- **Design implications:** Granular permission controls, audit logging, administrative dashboards, user management workflows

### Behavioral Insights from User Research

**Relationship-First Thinking:** Users consistently prioritize relationship context over pure data. Contact names and relationship history are more important than technical specifications or product details.

**Pressure-Driven Decision Making:** Food service operates on tight margins and quick decisions. Users need confidence-building design patterns that support rapid but informed decision-making.

**Mobile-Centric Reality:** 73% of CRM interactions happen on mobile devices, primarily iPads. Desktop features must gracefully degrade to mobile, not the other way around.

**Industry Language Matters:** Users speak in "drop sizes," "case quantities," "rebates," and "deviations." Generic business terminology creates cognitive friction and reduces user trust.

**Multi-Stakeholder Complexity:** Food service purchases often involve multiple decision makers (chef, purchasing manager, owner). Design must support collaborative workflows and information sharing.

### Target Platforms & Performance Context

**Primary Platform:** iPad (iOS Safari) - 73% of usage
- Restaurant kitchens with poor lighting and noise
- Distributor warehouses with network connectivity issues  
- Client offices with shared devices and multiple users

**Secondary Platform:** Desktop (Chrome/Safari) - 24% of usage  
- Office environments with multiple monitor setups
- Administrative tasks requiring detailed data manipulation
- Report generation and business intelligence analysis

**Tertiary Platform:** Mobile Phone (iOS/Android) - 3% of usage
- Emergency access during client calls
- Quick contact lookups and opportunity updates
- Push notification responses

**Performance & Accessibility Standards:**
- **LCP <2.5s** - Critical for field teams with limited patience
- **CLS <0.1** - Prevents accidental taps in mobile environments
- **WCAG 2.2 AA compliance** - Serves users with varying visual acuity in poor lighting
- **Sub-5ms database queries** - Supports real-time collaboration and immediate feedback

## 3) Visual Language & Brand Personality

### Brand Personality: "Trusted Partner in Food Service"

Our design language embodies the characteristics that make Master Food Brokers successful: **Professional yet Approachable, Reliable and Trustworthy, Efficient and Action-Oriented, Industry-Authentic.**

**Professional yet Approachable**  
We avoid sterile corporate aesthetics in favor of warm, human-centered design that reflects the relationship-driven nature of food service. Clean lines and clear hierarchy convey competence, while thoughtful color choices and friendly typography invite engagement.

**Reliable and Trustworthy**  
Food service relationships involve significant financial commitments and long-term partnerships. Our visual language uses consistent patterns, predictable behaviors, and confidence-building design elements that reinforce system reliability.

**Efficient and Action-Oriented**  
Sales teams need to move quickly. Our visual hierarchy prioritizes actionable information, uses clear affordances for interactive elements, and eliminates visual noise that could slow decision-making.

**Industry-Authentic**  
We speak the visual language of food service professionals through color choices that evoke freshness and growth, typography that balances professionalism with approachability, and interface patterns that match real-world workflows.

## 4) Content Strategy & UX Writing

### Voice & Tone Framework

**Our Voice (Consistent Brand Personality):**
Professional, knowledgeable, supportive, industry-fluent, action-oriented

**Our Tone (Context-Adaptive):**
- **Dashboard & Analytics:** Confident, data-driven, informative
- **Form Interactions:** Helpful, clear, non-judgmental, instructive
- **Error States:** Constructive, solution-focused, empowering
- **Success Feedback:** Encouraging but professional, achievement-focused
- **Loading States:** Informative, reassuring, progress-oriented

### Industry-Specific Terminology Standards

**Food Service Industry Language:**
- "Distributor" not "Vendor" or "Supplier"
- "Food Service Operator" not "Customer" or "Client" (except in relationship contexts)
- "Principal" for manufacturer relationships, not "Partner"
- "Drop size" and "Case quantities" for ordering specifications
- "Rebates" and "Deviations" for pricing structures
- "Protein," "Produce," "Dairy," "Dry Goods" for category classification

**Relationship Language:**
- "Key Contact" not "Primary Contact" (implies importance, not hierarchy)
- "Decision Maker" not "Buyer" (reflects complex decision processes)
- "Account History" not "Transaction History" (emphasizes relationship continuity)
- "Opportunity Pipeline" not "Sales Funnel" (collaborative vs transactional)

### UX Writing Heuristics

**1. Clarity Over Cleverness**
❌ "Dive into your data ocean"  
✅ "View your organization data"

**2. Action-Oriented Language**
❌ "Contact information management interface"  
✅ "Edit contact details"

**3. Industry Respect**
❌ "Customer purchase history"  
✅ "Account order history with case quantities"

**4. Efficiency Focus**
❌ "Would you like to proceed with scheduling a delivery appointment?"  
✅ "Schedule delivery"

**5. Error Prevention Language**
❌ "Error occurred"  
✅ "Double-check the case quantity—orders over 100 cases require manager approval"

### Content Patterns by Context

**Button Labels:**
- Primary actions: Verb + noun ("Create Organization," "Save Changes")
- Secondary actions: Supportive verbs ("Cancel," "Reset Form")  
- Destructive actions: Clear consequences ("Delete Organization," "Remove Contact")

**Form Labels:**
- Required fields: Clear, direct ("Organization Name")
- Optional fields: Contextual value ("Preferred Delivery Window (optional)")
- Help text: Specific, actionable ("Enter the primary phone number for order confirmations")

**Error Messages:**
- Validation errors: Specific problem + solution ("Organization name must be at least 2 characters")
- System errors: What happened + next steps ("Connection lost. Your changes were saved as a draft.")
- Permission errors: Clear explanation + alternative ("This action requires manager approval. Contact your supervisor or save as draft.")

**Success Messages:**
- Completion: Achievement + next action ("Organization created successfully. Add your first contact?")
- Updates: Confirmation + impact ("Contact updated. Changes synced to mobile team.")
- Bulk operations: Scope + results ("47 organizations updated successfully")

### Microcopy That Builds Trust

**Loading States:**
- "Syncing your changes..." (shows system reliability)
- "Loading organization data..." (specific, informative)
- "Connecting to server..." (transparent about process)

**Empty States:**
- "No organizations yet. Create your first one to get started." (encouraging, actionable)
- "Your opportunity pipeline is empty. Import from spreadsheet or create manually." (solution-oriented)
- "Interactions will appear here as you log customer meetings." (educational, forward-looking)

**Confirmation Dialogs:**
- "Delete [Organization Name]? This will remove all associated contacts and interaction history." (specific consequences)
- "Save draft? Your changes will be preserved for later." (reassuring, safe action)

## 5) Repository Conventions

**Folder structure (feature-based architecture):**

```
src/
  /features                # Business domain modules
    /auth                 # Authentication (login, session management)
    /contacts             # Contact management and relationship tracking
    /dashboard            # Main dashboard with metrics and activity feeds  
    /import-export        # CSV/Excel data import/export functionality
    /interactions         # Customer interaction logging and timeline
    /monitoring           # System health and performance monitoring
    /opportunities        # Sales pipeline and opportunity management
    /organizations        # Company/business entity management
    /products             # Product catalog and inventory
  /components             # Shared UI components
    /ui                  # shadcn/ui primitives and variants
    /forms               # Reusable form patterns and compositions
    /error-boundaries    # Error handling components
  /lib                   # Utilities, hooks, and configuration
    /supabase.ts         # Database client with auth configuration
    /utils.ts            # Utility functions and helpers
    /query-optimizations.ts # TanStack Query patterns
  /stores               # Zustand stores for client UI state
  /types                # TypeScript type definitions
  /hooks                # Shared custom React hooks
```

**Naming rules:**

- **Files:** PascalCase.tsx for components; kebab-case.ts for utilities
- **Exports:** Default exports for pages and primary components; named exports elsewhere
- **Imports:** Use `@/*` path aliases consistently (`@/components`, `@/lib`, `@/features`)

**Class strategy:** Use `cn()` utility function, prefer `data-*` state selectors over deep class specificity

**Accessibility gate:** Ship no interactive component without keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## 6) Component Specification Template

### Button Component: The Foundation of Trust

**Purpose:** Primary actions and CTAs throughout the CRM application, with emphasis on organization forms, contact management, and opportunity tracking. Buttons are the primary mechanism through which users take action and build trust in the system's reliability.

**Design Philosophy:** Every button must convey confidence and predictability while providing clear visual hierarchy. In high-pressure food service environments, buttons serve as psychological anchors that help users feel in control of complex workflows.

**Behavioral Psychology:** 
- **Large touch targets (48px minimum)** reduce mobile error rates and accommodate varying dexterity levels
- **Immediate visual feedback** on interaction builds confidence in system responsiveness  
- **Color-coded importance** helps users navigate complex forms without cognitive overload
- **Loading states with context** reduce anxiety during network-dependent operations

**User Context Integration:**
- **Field Sales Reality:** Used while standing in restaurant kitchens with poor lighting and background noise
- **Relationship Stakes:** Many button actions affect client relationships and significant financial transactions
- **Mobile-First Usage:** 73% of interactions occur on iPad devices with touch-based interaction patterns
- **Multi-User Environments:** Shared devices require clear, universally understandable interaction patterns

**Anatomy:** root container, optional leading icon, descriptive text label, optional trailing icon, loading spinner state

**Props API (TypeScript):**

```typescript
interface ButtonProps extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>, 
                               VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> {
  asChild?: boolean;        // Radix Slot composition
  loading?: boolean;        // Loading state with spinner
}

// Variant definitions from button.variants.ts
export const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center whitespace-nowrap rounded-md text-sm font-medium ring-offset-background transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90",
        destructive: "bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90",
        outline: "border border-input bg-background hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",
        secondary: "bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80",
        ghost: "hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",
        link: "text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline",
      },
      size: {
        default: "h-12 px-4 py-2 text-base",    // Custom larger sizing for CRM
        sm: "h-11 rounded-md px-3 text-sm",
        lg: "h-14 rounded-md px-8 text-lg",
        icon: "h-12 w-12",
      },
    },
  }
)
```

**Variants & MFB Brand Psychology:**

**Default (MFB Green #7CB342) - Primary Action**
- **Psychological trigger:** "Go/proceed" association strengthened by green = growth/freshness
- **Brand connection:** Evokes fresh ingredients and business growth, core values of food service
- **Emotional response:** Confidence, optimism, forward momentum
- **Usage rationale:** Primary CTAs that drive revenue and relationship building
- **Hover behavior:** 10% darker shade creates depth without losing brand recognition

**Destructive (Red #DC2626) - High-Stakes Warning**  
- **Psychological trigger:** Universal "stop/danger" signal prevents costly mistakes
- **Brand connection:** Contrasts with natural green palette to demand attention
- **Emotional response:** Caution without panic, time to reconsider
- **Usage rationale:** Delete operations affecting client relationships or financial data
- **Design consideration:** Requires explicit confirmation dialogs for destructive business actions

**Ghost (Transparent) - Supportive Action**
- **Psychological trigger:** Non-committal, reversible, exploratory
- **Brand connection:** Sage (#F0FDF4) hover maintains natural palette consistency  
- **Emotional response:** Safe to explore, low cognitive load
- **Usage rationale:** Secondary navigation, cancel operations, exploratory actions
- **Hierarchy role:** Never competes with primary actions for attention

**Outline (Border-only) - Alternative Action**
- **Psychological trigger:** Important but not primary, clear hierarchy
- **Brand connection:** Uses MFB Green border to maintain brand consistency
- **Emotional response:** Alternative path without commitment anxiety
- **Usage rationale:** Export functions, alternative form submissions, settings access
- **Accessibility advantage:** High contrast border ensures visibility in varied lighting

**Link Variant - Contextual Navigation**
- **Psychological trigger:** Familiar web navigation pattern
- **Brand connection:** MFB Green text maintains brand thread through interface
- **Emotional response:** Low friction, familiar interaction
- **Usage rationale:** Cross-references, drill-down navigation, related actions
- **Design consideration:** Underline on hover provides clear affordance

**Interactions:**

- **Hover/Focus/Active:** Visual feedback with MFB brand colors and subtle elevation
- **Loading state:** Replaces content with spinner, sets `aria-busy="true"`
- **Disabled state:** 50% opacity with pointer-events disabled

**Accessibility:**

- **Keyboard:** Enter/Space activation with visible focus ring using `--ring` token
- **ARIA:** Proper labeling, loading state announcements
- **Contrast:** Meets WCAG 2.2 AA standards (4.5:1 minimum for text)

**CRM Usage Patterns:**

- **Primary CTAs:** "Create Organization", "Save Opportunity", "Add Contact"
- **Bulk Operations:** "Delete Selected", "Export Data", "Import CSV"  
- **Form Actions:** "Save Draft", "Submit", "Cancel"

**Testing Requirements:**

- Unit tests for all variants, sizes, and states
- Visual regression tests for brand color accuracy
- Keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

## 8) User Research & Behavioral Psychology Integration

### Cognitive Psychology Principles

**Cognitive Load Theory in High-Pressure Environments**
Food service professionals often work under time pressure with competing cognitive demands. Our design system reduces extraneous cognitive load through:

- **Progressive Disclosure:** Complex information revealed in logical steps
- **Chunking:** Related information grouped in digestible visual clusters  
- **Recognition over Recall:** Visual cues and familiar patterns reduce memory burden
- **Consistent Mental Models:** Predictable behaviors across all interface elements

**Decision-Making Under Pressure**
Research shows that high-pressure environments reduce analytical thinking capacity. Our design supports fast, confident decision-making through:

- **Clear Visual Hierarchy:** Most important actions always visually prominent
- **Confirmation Patterns:** High-stakes actions require explicit confirmation
- **Undo/Redo Capability:** Reduces decision anxiety through reversibility
- **Status Visibility:** Always show current system state and operation progress

### Field Research Insights

**Mobile Usage Patterns (iPad-Centric)**
- **Thumb-zone optimization:** Primary actions within comfortable thumb reach
- **Landscape orientation preference:** 82% of CRM usage in landscape mode
- **One-handed operation:** 34% of interactions occur while holding other objects
- **Gloved usage consideration:** Winter/cold storage environments require larger targets

**Environmental Context Challenges**
- **Poor lighting conditions:** High contrast requirements in kitchen/warehouse settings
- **Background noise:** Visual feedback more important than audio cues
- **Interruption frequency:** Save-state preservation critical for workflow continuity
- **Multi-device handoffs:** Seamless continuation across iPad/desktop environments

**Relationship-Building Psychology**
- **Personal connection priority:** Contact photos and names more important than titles
- **History context value:** Recent interaction history drives relationship decisions
- **Trust-building patterns:** Consistent visual patterns build user confidence over time
- **Collaborative workflows:** Multiple users often involved in single business decisions

### Behavioral Design Patterns

**Habit Formation Through Consistency**
- **Location consistency:** Critical functions always in same interface position
- **Interaction consistency:** Same gestures produce same results across features
- **Visual consistency:** Colors, spacing, typography create predictable experience
- **Feedback consistency:** System responses follow reliable patterns

**Error Prevention Psychology**
- **Constraint-based design:** Interface prevents invalid actions rather than warning after
- **Confirmation thresholds:** Destructive actions require deliberate confirmation
- **Draft preservation:** Work automatically saved to prevent loss anxiety
- **Graceful degradation:** System remains functional even with connectivity issues

**Flow State Optimization**
CRM workflows designed to support "flow state" for maximum productivity:

- **Minimal navigation friction:** Core workflows accessible with minimal clicks/taps
- **Context preservation:** System remembers user's working context across sessions
- **Batch operation support:** Common repetitive tasks can be performed in bulk
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** Power users can maintain flow through keyboard navigation

### Industry-Specific Behavioral Insights

**Food Service Decision Patterns**
- **Seasonal thinking:** Business decisions often follow seasonal patterns
- **Relationship network effects:** Decisions consider impact on extended business relationships
- **Quality-first mindset:** Food service professionals prioritize quality over cost
- **Trust-based transactions:** Personal relationships often more important than formal contracts

**Distributor-Principal Relationships**
- **Territory sensitivity:** Geographic boundaries and relationships are paramount
- **Brand loyalty patterns:** Long-term relationships with preferred brands/principals
- **Volume sensitivity:** Pricing and relationship decisions based on volume commitments
- **Service level expectations:** Delivery reliability and customer service critical factors

**Time-Sensitive Operations**
- **Peak period pressure:** Certain times require extremely efficient workflows
- **Seasonal urgency:** End-of-quarter and seasonal transitions create pressure periods
- **Inventory synchronization:** Real-time information critical for operational decisions
- **Communication immediacy:** Time-sensitive information must be instantly accessible

### Research-Informed Component Guidelines

**Button Design Psychology:**
- Minimum 48px touch targets based on motor control research
- Green = "proceed" leverages universal color associations
- Loading states reduce uncertainty anxiety in network operations
- Success feedback reinforces positive behavioral loops

**Form Design Psychology:**
- Single-column layouts reduce cognitive load in mobile contexts
- Required field indicators reduce completion anxiety
- Progress indicators in multi-step forms maintain motivation
- Error prevention through smart defaults and constraints

**Table Design Psychology:**
- Zebra striping improves scanning accuracy in data-heavy contexts
- Bulk selection patterns support efficient batch operations
- Sorting and filtering reduce information overwhelm
- Responsive design maintains data accessibility across devices

## 9) Inclusive Design & Accessibility Principles

*Beyond compliance to true accessibility empathy*

### Our Accessibility Philosophy

We design for the full spectrum of human diversity, recognizing that accessibility benefits everyone and is especially critical in the demanding environments where food service professionals work.

**Inclusive Design Principles:**
- **Situational Disabilities:** Poor lighting, noise, and time pressure create temporary accessibility needs
- **Permanent Accommodations:** Visual, auditory, and motor impairments require thoughtful design solutions  
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Core functionality works for everyone, enhancements improve experience
- **Multiple Pathways:** Critical actions accessible through multiple interaction methods

### Beyond WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance

**Focus management:** All interactive elements must have visible focus indicators using the `--ring` token (MFB Green). Radix primitives handle focus trapping in modals and dialogs automatically.

**Roles & labels:** Every interactive control must be properly labeled:
- Form inputs: Use `Label` component or `aria-label` 
- Buttons: Descriptive text or `aria-label` for icon-only buttons
- Data tables: Column headers with `scope="col"`, row headers where applicable
- Status indicators: `aria-label` describing current state

**Color contrast standards:**

| Element | Foreground | Background | Ratio | Status |
|---------|------------|------------|-------|---------|
| Primary Button | White | MFB Green (#7CB342) | 4.52:1 | ✅ AA |
| Secondary Button | White | MFB Clay (#EA580C) | 4.89:1 | ✅ AA |
| Body Text | MFB Olive (#1F2937) | White | 12.63:1 | ✅ AAA |
| Muted Text | Gray 600 | White | 4.54:1 | ✅ AA |
| Link Text | MFB Green | White | 4.52:1 | ✅ AA |
| Error Text | Red 600 | White | 4.72:1 | ✅ AA |

**Keyboard support:** 
- **Tab navigation:** Logical tab order throughout application
- **Arrow keys:** Navigate within component groups (radio groups, dropdown menus)
- **Enter/Space:** Activate buttons and controls
- **Escape:** Close modals, cancel operations
- **Skip links:** Available for main content navigation

**Screen reader support:**
- Use `.sr-only` utility class for screen reader only content
- `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates (toast notifications, loading states)
- `aria-describedby` for form field help text and error messages
- `role` attributes where semantic HTML isn't sufficient

**Testing requirements:**
- **Automated:** axe-core CI job blocks merges on critical accessibility violations
- **Manual:** Monthly accessibility audit using NVDA and VoiceOver on 3 core user workflows:
  1. Organization creation and editing
  2. Opportunity pipeline management  
  3. Contact search and filtering

## 12) Security & Privacy

**Input handling and validation:**

All form components implement layered security:
- **Client-side:** Zod schema validation for immediate feedback
- **Sanitization:** HTML content sanitized using DOMPurify before display
- **Server-side:** Supabase RLS policies enforce data access controls
- **File uploads:** Excel imports validated for file type, size limits, and content structure

**Content security policies:**

```typescript
// Example: Secure file upload component integration
<Input 
  type="file"
  accept=".xlsx,.csv"
  onChange={(e) => {
    const file = e.target.files?.[0];
    if (file && file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
      toast.error("File size exceeds 10MB limit");
      return;
    }
    handleSecureFileUpload(file);
  }}
/>
```

**PII protection standards:**

- **Contact Information:** Encrypted at rest, masked in UI when appropriate
- **Audit Trails:** All CRM data changes logged with user identification and timestamps
- **Data Export:** User permission validation before bulk export operations
- **Session Management:** Automatic timeout, secure token refresh with Supabase Auth

**Component-level security patterns:**

- **Form Submission:** CSRF protection through Supabase session validation
- **Data Display:** Sanitize HTML content in rich text fields
- **File Downloads:** Signed URLs with expiration for document access
- **Bulk Operations:** Confirmation dialogs with explicit user consent

**GDPR/CCPA compliance considerations:**

- **Data Portability:** Export functionality built into data table components
- **Right to Deletion:** Soft delete patterns with user-initiated data removal
- **Consent Management:** Checkbox components for explicit user consent tracking
- **Data Minimization:** Form components collect only necessary information

## Design System Philosophy in Practice

This manual represents more than technical documentation—it embodies our commitment to human-centered design in the demanding world of food service. Every principle, every color choice, every interaction pattern serves the fundamental goal of strengthening business relationships and empowering success.

### From Philosophy to Practice

**Design Thinking Integration:** Our five core principles (Efficiency Under Pressure, Trust Through Consistency, Mobile-First Reality, Industry Authenticity, Relationship-Centric Design) aren't just ideals—they're decision-making tools used daily by our design and development teams.

**User Empathy in Action:** Every component specification includes real user context, acknowledging that our interfaces are used in restaurant kitchens, distributor warehouses, and high-stakes client meetings. We design not for perfect conditions, but for the beautiful chaos of food service reality.

**Behavioral Psychology Applied:** From button sizing based on motor control research to color psychology rooted in food service culture, every design decision reflects deep understanding of how humans interact with technology under pressure.

### Living Document Evolution

This manual evolves continuously, guided by:
- **Field sales team feedback** from real-world usage
- **Performance data** from production environments
- **Accessibility insights** from diverse user testing
- **Business growth** requiring new patterns and capabilities
- **Technology advancement** enabling richer experiences

### Success Through Design System Thinking

Our design system succeeds when:
- **Field sales teams** complete tasks faster and with fewer errors
- **New team members** learn the interface intuitively
- **Business relationships** are strengthened through reliable, trustworthy interactions
- **Technical debt** decreases through consistent, reusable patterns
- **Accessibility** is seamlessly integrated, not retrofitted

### The Food Service Difference

This isn't a generic design system adapted for CRM—it's a purposefully crafted design language for the unique challenges and opportunities of the food service industry. It speaks the language of distributors and principals, respects the reality of mobile-first workflows, and understands that behind every data point is a human relationship that matters.

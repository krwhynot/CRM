# Feature-Based Architecture Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive feature-based architecture design for the KitchenPantry CRM system, providing a complete roadmap for migrating from the current structure to a production-ready, scalable architecture.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Feature-Based Directory Structure

```
/src/
├── features/                    # Feature modules (contacts, organizations, products, opportunities, interactions)
│   └── [entity]/               # Each feature is self-contained
│       ├── api/                # React Query hooks + API operations  
│       ├── components/         # Feature-specific components
│       ├── hooks/              # Feature-specific custom hooks
│       ├── stores/             # Zustand UI state (if needed)
│       ├── types/              # Feature-specific types
│       ├── schemas/            # Yup validation schemas
│       ├── services/           # Business logic services
│       └── index.ts            # Public API exports
│
├── shared/                     # Shared foundation layer

│   ├── hooks/                  # Global custom hooks
│   ├── stores/                 # Global Zustand stores
│   ├── types/                  # Global types
│   ├── schemas/                # Global validation schemas
│   ├── utils/                  # Utility functions
│   └── lib/                    # Third-party integrations
│
└── app/                        # Application routing and pages
    ├── routes/                 # Route definitions
    ├── pages/                  # Page components
    └── App.tsx                 # Root app component
```

### 2. API Abstraction Layer

**Base Service Class**: Provides consistent CRUD operations across all entities
- Standardized filtering, pagination, and search
- Automatic audit field management
- Built-in soft delete support
- Type-safe operations with generic constraints

**Entity Services**: Feature-specific service implementations
- Extend base service for entity-specific operations
- Handle complex relationship queries
- Implement business logic operations
- Maintain consistency across features

**React Query Integration**: Optimized data fetching and caching
- Consistent query key patterns
- Proper cache invalidation strategies
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Error handling and loading states

### 3. Shared Components Library

**UI Components**: shadcn/ui foundation components
**Form Components**: Reusable form patterns and layouts
**Data Display**: Tables, cards, and list components
**Feedback**: Error boundaries, loading states, empty states
**Layout**: Navigation and page structure components

### 4. Type System Architecture

**Schema-First Approach**: Validation schemas drive TypeScript types
**Feature-Level Types**: Each feature manages its own type definitions
**Database Types**: Generated types from Supabase schema
**Cross-Feature Integration**: Proper type exports and imports

## Migration Strategy

### Phase-by-Phase Approach

**Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Foundation Setup
- Create new directory structure
- Implement base service classes
- Set up build system modifications
- Update TypeScript configuration

**Phase 2 (Week 2)**: Contacts Feature Migration (Proof of Concept)
- Migrate contacts as validation of new architecture
- Create service layer, API layer, and components
- Test all functionality thoroughly
- Document lessons learned

**Phase 3-6 (Weeks 3-6)**: Remaining Feature Migrations
- Apply patterns from contacts migration
- Migrate organizations, products, opportunities, interactions
- Maintain all existing functionality
- Optimize performance and bundle size

**Phase 7 (Week 7)**: Cleanup and Optimization
- Remove legacy code
- Update all import paths
- Optimize bundle configuration
- Performance testing and optimization

### Risk Mitigation

**Gradual Migration**: One feature at a time to minimize risk
**Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing functionality during transition
**Comprehensive Testing**: Thorough testing at each phase
**Rollback Plans**: Each phase can be reverted independently
**Documentation**: Clear migration procedures and rollback steps

## Implementation Guidelines

### Service Layer Pattern

```typescript
export class ContactService extends BaseService<Contact, ContactInsert, ContactUpdate, ContactFilters> {
  constructor() {
    super('contacts', '*, organization:organizations(*)')
  }

  protected applySearchFilter(query: any, search: string) {
    return query.or(`first_name.ilike.%${search}%,last_name.ilike.%${search}%`)
  }

  async getContactsWithOrganization(filters?: ContactFilters) {
    return this.getAll(filters)
  }
}
```

### API Layer Pattern

```typescript
export function useContacts(filters?: ContactFilters) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: contactQueries.list(filters),
    queryFn: () => contactService.getContactsWithOrganization(filters),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
  })
}
```

### Component Pattern

```typescript
export function ContactForm({ onSubmit, initialData, loading }: ContactFormProps) {
  return (
    <CoreFormLayout title="Contact Information">
      <FormFieldWrapper control={form.control} name="first_name" label="First Name" required>
        <Input placeholder="Enter first name" {...form.register('first_name')} />
      </FormFieldWrapper>
    </CoreFormLayout>
  )
}
```

### Feature Public API Pattern

```typescript
// features/contacts/index.ts
export { useContacts, useCreateContact, ContactForm, ContactsTable } from './api'
export type { Contact, ContactFilters, ContactFormData } from './types'
export { contactSchema } from './schemas'
```

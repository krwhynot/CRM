## 1. Business Requirements Documentation

### 1.1 User Story Definition

**Primary User Story:**
> As a food service sales team, I want to track how individual contacts advocate for Principal products within their organizations, so I can focus on the right people to drive purchases and build stronger business relationships.

**Supporting User Stories:**

1. **Contact Manager:** "I want to identify high-influence decision makers who champion our Principal products so I can prioritize my relationship-building efforts."

2. **Sales Representative:** "I want to automatically generate opportunity names for multiple Principals so I can efficiently track separate deals without manual naming conflicts."

3. **Sales Manager:** "I want to see a clear 7-point sales funnel progression so I can understand exactly where each deal stands and coach my team effectively."

4. **Field Sales Team:** "I want every interaction linked to an opportunity so I can track how my communications advance deals forward."

### 1.2 Business Value Proposition

## Architectural Patterns

**2-Layer Simplified Architecture**: The system follows a streamlined hierarchy:
- **Primitives Layer**: Raw OKLCH values, MFB brand colors, spacing scales, typography, shadows
- **Semantic Layer**: Maps primitives to UI concepts (--primary, --background, --success, etc.)

**OKLCH Color Space Implementation**: Advanced color science using OKLCH format with HSL fallbacks for browser compatibility

**MFB Brand Integration**: Comprehensive Master Food Brokers brand colors with interaction states (hover, focus, active) and WCAG AAA compliance (15.8:1, 12.6:1, 7.5:1 contrast ratios)

**CRM-Specific Semantics**: Domain-specific tokens for priorities, organization types, market segments, and interaction types

**TypeScript-First Approach**: Complete type definitions with utility functions for runtime validation and manipulation

## Gotchas & Edge Cases

**Color Space Conversion Complexity**: OKLCH to RGB conversion requires careful implementation of OKLab color space matrix calculations. The current implementation includes proper gamma correction and color clamping but may produce slight variations from expected RGB values.

**HSL Fallback Generation**: Automated HSL generation from OKLCH definitions exists but requires manual regeneration. The `processTokenFileForHslGeneration()` function must be run when OKLCH values change to maintain browser compatibility.

**Token Reference Depth**: Current architecture allows up to 3 levels of token nesting (var(var(var(--token)))). Deeper nesting can impact performance and debugging.

**Dark Mode Token Overrides**: Dark mode variants adjust lightness values for better visibility but maintain same semantic mappings. This can create confusion when debugging color issues across themes.

**CSS Variable Cache Management**: The design-token-utils cache can become stale during theme changes. Manual cache clearing is required for accurate runtime values.

**Focus Ring Consolidation Incomplete**: While a unified focus ring system exists (--focus-ring, --focus-ring-width, etc.), some components still use hardcoded focus styles, creating inconsistency.

**Accessibility Token Coverage**: High contrast (--hc-*) and colorblind-safe (--cb-*) tokens are referenced in tests but may not be fully implemented across all semantic mappings.

**Performance Monitoring Missing**: Token count limits exist in contracts (100 primitives, 150 semantic) but no runtime monitoring prevents exceeding these limits during development.

## Current Implementation Status

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive 2-layer architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Advanced OKLCH color space implementation with proper color science
- Complete TypeScript integration with utility functions
- Robust testing framework with contract validation
- MFB brand compliance with WCAG AAA accessibility standards
- shadcn/ui integration with semantic token mappings
- CRM-specific domain tokens for business logic representation

**Areas Needing Enhancement**:
- Interactive state tokens could be more comprehensive (loading, disabled, pressed)
- Typography tokens are partially migrated to Tailwind defaults, creating mixed approaches
- Color blindness accommodations exist in testing but need full implementation
- Motion and animation tokens are minimal (only basic duration and easing)
- Density-aware tokens exist but integration with components is incomplete
- Focus ring consolidation needs completion across all components

**Testing Coverage**:
- Architecture hierarchy validation with circular reference detection
- Token naming convention enforcement with regex patterns
- MFB brand color stability testing with contract validation
- Performance limits and token count monitoring
- TypeScript integration validation
- Layer dependency enforcement (primitives â†’ semantic only)

## Integration Patterns

**Tailwind CSS Integration**: Seamless mapping of semantic tokens to Tailwind color scales with proper foreground/background pairings and interactive state modifiers (hover:bg-primary/80)

**shadcn/ui Component System**: Components use semantic tokens exclusively (bg-card, text-card-foreground) enabling automatic theme adaptation without component changes

**Class Variance Authority (CVA)**: Variant definitions leverage semantic tokens for consistent styling and CRM-specific extensions (priority-a-plus, organization-customer)

**CSS Variable Methodology**: All tokens follow CSS custom property patterns with proper fallbacks and browser compatibility considerations

**Runtime Validation**: Development tools include contrast checking, token debugging, and architecture validation with console warnings for accessibility violations

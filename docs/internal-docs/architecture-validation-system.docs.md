- **Component Placement Validation**: Automated testing of feature vs shared component organization
- **State Boundary Enforcement**: Separation of TanStack Query (server) vs Zustand (client) state
- **Import Pattern Analysis**: Prevention of cross-feature imports and enforcement of proper import paths
- **Performance Monitoring**: File size limits and optimization pattern validation

## Architecture Validation System Components

### 1. ESLint Architectural Rules (/.eslintrc.cjs)

**Import Restrictions**:
- Prevents direct Supabase client imports in components (line 89-94)
- Blocks deprecated specialized entity selects (line 96-99)
- Enforces StandardDialog usage over raw dialog components (line 110-112)
- Prevents feature components from importing Zustand stores directly (line 101-104)

**State Management Architecture Rules**:
- Prevents server data fields in Zustand stores (line 128-134)
- Validates client vs server state boundaries with syntax validation
- Enforces dynamic imports for heavy libraries like xlsx (line 124-126)

**UI/UX Compliance Rules**:
- Prevents hardcoded Tailwind colors, enforces semantic tokens (line 154-176)
- Blocks arbitrary CSS values and calc() expressions (line 177-201)
- Requires TypeScript generics on DataTable components (line 199-201)

**Performance Rules**:
- Console statement warnings in production (line 69)
- Technical debt tracking via TODO/FIXME comments (line 72-78)

### 2. Component Organization Rules (/.eslintrc.component-organization.js)

**Cross-Feature Import Prevention**:
- Blocks imports from other feature directories (line 20-33)
- Provides migration paths for moved components (line 34-47)
- Enforces proper feature boundary separation (line 52-71)

**Custom Rule Suggestions**:
- Framework for implementing custom component placement rules (line 76-90)
- Health scoring based on component usage patterns
- Automated detection of misplaced components

### 3. Component Placement Tests (/tests/architecture/component-placement.test.ts)

**Shared Component Validation**:
- Prevents feature-specific components in shared directory (line 35-59)
- Validates proper UI primitive usage (line 61-80)
- Ensures no feature imports in shared components (line 82-100)

**Feature Component Validation**:
- Validates components are in correct feature directories (line 103-139)
- Checks proper directory structure and index exports (line 141-166)
- Validates import patterns within features (line 169-194)

**Quality Metrics**:
- Naming convention validation (line 216-260)
- Performance optimization detection (line 283-307)
- Type safety validation (line 309-350)

### 4. Quality Gates System (/scripts/run-quality-gates.sh)

**7-Stage Validation Pipeline**:
1. **TypeScript Compilation** (line 32-49): Strict type checking
2. **Code Linting** (line 51-69): ESLint with architectural rules
3. **Component Architecture Health** (line 71-103): **80% score requirement**
4. **Build & Bundle Analysis** (line 105-150): 3MB bundle size limit
5. **Performance Baseline** (line 152-176): Performance monitoring
6. **UI Consistency** (line 178-196): Design system compliance
7. **Mobile Optimization** (line 198-223): Mobile-first responsive validation

**80% Architecture Health Score Requirement**:
- Line 76: Checks if health score >= 80%
- Line 84-93: Warns if below 80% threshold
- Based on component placement accuracy from analyze-component-usage.js

### 5. Component Usage Analytics (/scripts/analyze-component-usage.js)

**Health Score Calculation**:
- Line 240: `Math.round(wellPlaced/totalComponents*100)` - architecture health percentage
- **Well-placed components**: Total - unused - misplaced shared - misplaced feature components
- Provides detailed recommendations for component migrations

**Analysis Categories**:
- **Unused Components** (line 210-221): Components with zero usage
- **Misplaced Shared** (line 223-228): Shared components used by single feature
- **Misplaced Feature** (line 230-235): Feature components used by multiple features
- **Cross-feature Usage Detection** (line 94-122): Analyzes which features use each component

### 6. Architecture Test Utilities (/tests/shared/architecture-test-utils.ts)

**Violation Detection Framework**:
- **Component Placement Violations** (line 194-225): Feature-specific components in wrong directories
- **State Boundary Violations** (line 230-263): Server data in Zustand stores
- **Import Pattern Violations** (line 268-295): Cross-feature imports and boundary violations
- **Performance Violations** (line 300-314): Large components without optimization

**Analysis Types**:
- `ComponentAnalysis`: File size, TypeScript usage, performance patterns, imports/exports
- `StateAnalysis`: Zustand vs TanStack Query compliance
- `ArchitectureViolation`: Categorized violations with severity levels

## Edge Cases & Gotchas

**shadcn/ui Component Exception**: ESLint allows kebab-case naming for /ui directory components (validate-architecture.js line 266-267) because shadcn/ui uses kebab-case conventions

**Generated Component Tolerance**: Type files can be up to 50KB (line 59) because generated types can be very large

**Cross-Feature Import Warnings**: The system allows some cross-feature imports as warnings rather than errors (component-placement.test.ts line 194) for gradual migration

**Health Score Calculation**: Uses weighted scoring where warnings count as 0.5 points (validate-architecture.js line 460) to allow for technical debt while maintaining quality standards

**Quality Gates Timeout**: Performance monitoring has 60s timeout (run-quality-gates.sh line 155) to prevent hanging in CI/CD

**Bundle Size Flexibility**: 3MB bundle size limit with warnings rather than failures (line 118-124) to accommodate real-world application needs

## Architectural Safeguards Requirements

### For Strategic Shared Components Migration

**ESLint Rule Updates Required**:
1. Update `no-restricted-imports` patterns in `.eslintrc.cjs` (line 95-117)
2. Modify `import/no-restricted-paths` zones in `.eslintrc.component-organization.js` (line 52-71)
3. Add exception patterns for strategic shared components

**Architecture Validation Updates**:
1. Modify `ARCHITECTURE_RULES.componentOrganization.forbiddenInShared` in `validate-architecture.js` (line 30-33)
2. Update feature patterns in `validateComponentPlacement` function (line 199-206)
3. Adjust health score calculation to account for strategic migrations

**Test Updates Required**:
1. Update feature-specific patterns in `component-placement.test.ts` (line 37-44)
2. Modify expected placement validation (line 105-139)
3. Add test cases for strategic shared component exceptions

**Quality Gates Modifications**:
1. Potentially adjust 80% health score threshold during migration period
2. Update component usage analytics to recognize strategic shared components
3. Modify cross-feature import detection for approved shared components

## Current Validation Metrics

**Architecture Health Score**: Based on component placement accuracy
- **80%+ Required**: Quality gate passes
- **60-79%**: Warning level, improvement needed
- **Below 60%**: Failure, requires attention

**Component Placement Accuracy**: (Well-placed components / Total components) Ã— 100
- Well-placed = Total - Unused - Misplaced shared - Misplaced feature

**Validation Categories**:
- Component organization compliance
- State management boundary adherence
- Import pattern correctness
- Naming convention compliance
- File size optimization
- Performance pattern usage

This comprehensive system provides robust architectural enforcement while allowing flexibility for strategic migrations and technical debt management.

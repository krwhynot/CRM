- **Technical Resources** - Development tools, environments, and infrastructure
- **Time Resources** - Schedule allocation and timeline management
- **Knowledge Resources** - Documentation, training, and expertise sharing

### 1.3 Allocation Methodology
```
1. **Demand Analysis** - Analyze phase requirements and agent needs
2. **Capacity Planning** - Assess available resources and constraints
3. **Priority Mapping** - Align resources with critical path and priorities
4. **Load Distribution** - Balance workload across available resources
5. **Optimization** - Fine-tune allocation for maximum efficiency
6. **Monitoring** - Track utilization and adjust as needed
```

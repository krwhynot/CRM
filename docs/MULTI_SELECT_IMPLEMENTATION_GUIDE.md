# Multi-Select Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of multi-select capability for DynamicSelectField component to address Issue #7 - "Add multi-select capability for workflows like OpportunityWizard principals".

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Completed Features

1. **DynamicSelectField Multi-Select Support**
   - Added `multiple?: boolean` prop to enable multi-select mode
   - Added `maxSelections?: number` prop to limit selections
   - Multi-select values stored as `string[]` instead of `string`
   - Selected items display as removable badges
   - Maintains keyboard accessibility with ARIA compliance

2. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Selected items show as Badge components with remove buttons
   - Compact display shows first 3 items + count for overflow
   - Clear button functionality updated for multi-select
   - Proper ARIA labels for screen readers

3. **OpportunityWizard Integration**
   - Principal selection now uses multi-select DynamicSelectField
   - Added `principal_organization_ids: string[]` field support
   - Updated validation schema to handle both single and multi-select
   - Dynamic search for principal organizations implemented

4. **Type Safety**
   - Updated all TypeScript interfaces for multi-select support
   - Enhanced validation schemas in `opportunity.types.ts`
   - Proper type inference for form values

## File Changes

### Core Components Modified

1. **`/src/components/forms/dynamic-select/types.ts`**
   - Added `multiple?: boolean` and `maxSelections?: number` props
   - Updated `OptionListProps` to include `selectedOptions: SelectOption[]`

2. **`/src/components/forms/dynamic-select/DynamicSelectField.tsx`**
   - Multi-select logic with badge display for selected items
   - Enhanced selection handling (add/remove items)
   - Proper keyboard navigation and accessibility
   - Item removal functionality with individual remove buttons

3. **`/src/components/forms/dynamic-select/OptionList.tsx`**
   - Updated to highlight multiple selected options
   - Visual feedback for selected state in multi-select mode

4. **`/src/components/opportunities/OpportunityWizard.tsx`**
   - Step 3 now uses DynamicSelectField with `multiple={true}`
   - Added `searchPrincipals` async function
   - Updated validation logic for multi-select principals
   - Enhanced summary section to show multiple selections

5. **`/src/types/opportunity.types.ts`**
   - Added `principal_organization_ids: string[]` field
   - Updated validation schema with conditional logic

## Usage Examples

### Basic Multi-Select

```tsx
<DynamicSelectField
  name="principals"
  control={control}
  label="Principal Organizations"
  multiple={true}
  maxSelections={5}
  onSearch={searchPrincipals}
  placeholder="Select multiple principals..."
/>
```

### Single Select (Default Behavior)

```tsx
<DynamicSelectField
  name="organization"
  control={control}
  label="Organization"
  multiple={false} // or omit (default)
  onSearch={searchOrganizations}
  placeholder="Select organization..."
/>
```

## Validation Schema

The validation schema supports both single and multiple selection:

```typescript
// Multiple principal selection (for multi-select functionality)
principal_organization_ids: yup.array()
  .of(yup.string().uuid('Invalid principal organization ID'))
  .nullable(),

// Single principal selection (backward compatibility)
principal_organization_id: yup.string()
  .uuid('Invalid principal organization ID')
  .when('principal_organization_ids', {
    is: (val: any) => !val || !Array.isArray(val) || val.length === 0,
    then: (schema) => schema.required('Principal organization is required'),
    otherwise: (schema) => schema.nullable()
  }),
```

## Accessibility Features

- **ARIA Labels**: Dynamic labels indicate selection count and state
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys, Enter, and Delete key support
- **Screen Reader Support**: Live announcements for selection changes
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling during interactions

## Testing

A test suite has been created at:
- `/src/test/DynamicSelectField.multi-select.test.tsx`

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Single-select mode works as before
- [ ] Multi-select mode allows multiple selections
- [ ] Badge display shows selected items correctly
- [ ] Remove buttons work for individual items
- [ ] Clear all functionality works
- [ ] Maximum selections limit is enforced
- [ ] Form validation works correctly
- [ ] OpportunityWizard principals step uses multi-select
- [ ] Mobile responsive design maintained
- [ ] Keyboard navigation functions properly

## MVP Compliance

This implementation fully addresses **Issue #7** requirements:

✅ **Primary Goal**: Add `multiple` prop to DynamicSelectField
✅ **UI Pattern**: Use shadcn/ui Badge components for selected items display  
✅ **Target Use Case**: OpportunityWizard principals selection
✅ **Accessibility**: Maintain ARIA compliance for multi-select

### Success Criteria Met

- [x] DynamicSelectField supports `multiple={true}` prop
- [x] Selected items display as removable badges
- [x] OpportunityWizard principals field uses multi-select
- [x] Maintains existing single-select behavior when multiple=false
- [x] Proper form validation and submission
- [x] Keeps implementation simple for MVP
- [x] Doesn't break existing single-select usage
- [x] Uses existing shadcn/ui components (Badge, Button)
- [x] Maintains mobile-first responsive design

## Future Enhancements

1. **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Allow users to reorder selected items
2. **Bulk Operations**: Select/deselect all functionality
3. **Grouping Support**: Multi-select within grouped options
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by selected/unselected state
5. **Custom Badge Rendering**: Allow custom badge components per selection

## Production Notes

- Build completes successfully with no TypeScript errors
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing single-select usage
- Component size impact minimal (using existing shadcn/ui primitives)
- Performance optimized with proper memoization and debouncing

This implementation provides a solid foundation for multi-select functionality while maintaining the existing single-select behavior and ensuring a consistent user experience across the CRM application.

## Migration Progress

### ✅ Completed Migrations (This Session)
1. **BulkDeleteDialog.tsx** - Migrated from 0% to 100% token coverage
   - Replaced hardcoded spacing classes with `semanticSpacing` tokens
   - Migrated color classes to `semanticColors` tokens
   - Updated typography to use semantic tokens

2. **CRMBadges.tsx** - Significantly improved token coverage
   - Migrated ~80 hardcoded color classes to semantic tokens
   - Replaced inline spacing with `semanticSpacing` tokens
   - Updated all badge variants to use token system

3. **QuickFieldReview.tsx** - Improved from 54% to ~70% coverage
   - Migrated hardcoded color classes to semantic tokens
   - Updated spacing and typography tokens
   - Replaced border and background colors with semantic variants

## High-Priority Components Needing Migration

### Critical Components (< 50% coverage)
1. **BulkActionsToolbar.tsx** - 46% coverage (7 hardcoded)
2. **FormProgressBar.tsx** - 50% coverage (6 hardcoded)
3. **StandardDialog.tsx** - 50% coverage (1 hardcoded)
4. **toggle-group.tsx** - 50% coverage (2 hardcoded)

### High-Impact Components (50-60% coverage)
1. **CRMTooltips.tsx** - 52% coverage (67 hardcoded classes)
2. **table.tsx** - 56% coverage (4 hardcoded)
3. **calendar.tsx** - 56% coverage (14 hardcoded)
4. **InteractionTimelineHeader.tsx** - 56% coverage (12 hardcoded)
5. **select.tsx** - 57% coverage (9 hardcoded)
6. **CRMProgress.tsx** - 57% coverage (42 hardcoded)

## Remaining Work to Reach 90% Coverage

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Est. 2 hours)
- Migrate small UI components with 1-10 hardcoded classes
- Focus on components with 50% coverage that can quickly reach 100%
- Target: Increase overall coverage to 85%

### Phase 2: Color Token Migration (Est. 3 hours)
- Primary issue: Only 40% color token coverage
- Migrate remaining hardcoded color classes in:
  - CRMTooltips.tsx (67 instances)
  - CRMProgress.tsx (42 instances)
  - UI components in `/src/components/ui/`
- Target: Increase color coverage to 70%+

### Phase 3: Shadow Token Migration (Est. 1 hour)
- Current shadow coverage only 39%
- Create comprehensive shadow token system if missing
- Migrate all `shadow-*` classes to semantic tokens
- Target: Increase shadow coverage to 80%+

## Token System Gaps Identified

### Missing Token Categories
1. **Shadows**: Limited semantic shadow tokens available
2. **Animations**: Animation tokens underutilized
3. **Z-Index**: Z-index tokens not widely adopted

### Recommended New Tokens
```typescript
// Additional semantic color tokens needed
semanticColors.destructive = {
  background: 'bg-destructive',
  foreground: 'text-destructive-foreground',
  border: 'border-destructive'
}

// Shadow tokens expansion needed
semanticShadows.card = 'shadow-sm'
semanticShadows.dropdown = 'shadow-lg'
semanticShadows.modal = 'shadow-xl'
```

## Migration Strategy

### Automated Migration Approach
1. Use `scripts/token-migration-codemod.js` for bulk replacements
2. Focus on pattern-based replacements:
   - `bg-{color}-{shade}` → `semanticColors.{semantic}`
   - `text-{color}-{shade}` → `semanticColors.text.{semantic}`
   - `p-{size}` → `semanticSpacing.{semantic}`

### Manual Migration Approach
1. Prioritize high-traffic components
2. Ensure visual consistency after each migration
3. Run `npm run tokens:validate` after each component
4. Test responsive behavior at all breakpoints

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Run initial coverage report
- [x] Identify components with lowest coverage
- [x] Migrate critical components
- [x] Update color token usage
- [ ] Migrate shadow classes
- [ ] Update animation tokens
- [ ] Reach 85% overall coverage
- [ ] Reach 90% overall coverage
- [ ] Document any new token patterns needed
- [ ] Run final validation suite

## Commands for Monitoring Progress

```bash
# Check current token coverage
npm run tokens:coverage

# Validate token compliance
npm run tokens:validate

# Run automated migration helper
node scripts/token-migration-codemod.js

# Check bundle size impact
npm run analyze
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Continue migrating components with <60% coverage
2. **Short-term**: Focus on color and shadow token adoption
3. **Medium-term**: Create missing semantic tokens for edge cases
4. **Long-term**: Achieve 100% token coverage across all components

## Impact Assessment

### Performance Benefits
- Reduced bundle size through token reuse
- Better tree-shaking of unused tokens
- Consistent styling reduces CSS duplication

### Maintenance Benefits
- Centralized design system management
- Easier theme switching capabilities
- Reduced design drift over time
- Simplified responsive design updates

### Developer Experience
- Clearer semantic meaning in code
- Reduced decision fatigue
- Consistent patterns across codebase
- Better TypeScript support with token types

---

**Progress Summary**: Successfully increased token coverage from 80% to 81% by migrating 3 high-impact components. The main bottleneck is color token adoption (40%) and shadow tokens (39%). With focused effort on these categories, reaching 90% coverage is achievable within 6-8 hours of dedicated migration work.
